## 3. REVENUE AND PAYOUTS

### 3.1 No Payouts Until $25,000 Revenue Milestone
- **No distributions or payouts** shall be made to either Co-Founder until SponsorSynq generates a total of **$25,000 in cumulative revenue**
- All revenue prior to this milestone must be reinvested into the business or held in reserve
- Both Co-Founders must unanimously agree when the $25,000 threshold has been reached

### 3.2 LLC Formation at $25,000 Milestone
Upon reaching $25,000 in total revenue, the Co-Founders agree to:
1. **Form a Limited Liability Company (LLC)** for SponsorSynq
2. **Open a business bank account** with both Co-Founders as joint account holders
3. **Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN)** from the IRS
4. **Draft and sign an Operating Agreement** reflecting this partnership structure
5. Register the LLC in an appropriate state (Delaware or state of primary operations)

### 3.3 Payout Structure and Reserve Requirements

**Recommended Payout Framework:**

Once the LLC is established and the $25,000 milestone is reached, payouts shall be structured as follows:

**Priority 1 - Operating Expenses:**
- All recurring business expenses (hosting, software, marketing) paid first

**Priority 2 - Emergency Reserve Fund:**
- Build and maintain a reserve equal to **6 months of average monthly operating expenses**
- This reserve protects the business during revenue fluctuations
- Reserve funds kept in business savings account
- May only be used for genuine business emergencies with unanimous consent

**Priority 3 - Growth Reinvestment:**
- Minimum **30% of net profit** (after expenses and reserves) reinvested into growth
- Used for scaling marketing, product development, and expansion
- Reinvestment percentage may be increased by mutual agreement

**Priority 4 - Co-Founder Distributions:**
- Remaining net profit distributed **equally (50/50)** to both Co-Founders
- Distributions made **monthly** or **quarterly** as agreed upon
- **Conservative recommendation:** Start with **quarterly distributions** of remaining profit
- Both Co-Founders must take equal amounts (no exceptions)

**Example Monthly Calculation:**
\`\`\`
Monthly Revenue:                 $10,000
- Operating Expenses:            -$2,000
- Emergency Reserve (if needed): -$1,200 (until 6-month target reached)
= Net Profit:                     $6,800
- Growth Reinvestment (30%):     -$2,040
= Available for Distribution:     $4,760
- Issiah's Share (50%):          $2,380
- Soya's Share (50%):            $2,380
\`\`\`

### 3.4 Reserve Fund Targets
- **Minimum Reserve:** 6 months of operating expenses (required before distributions begin)
- **Recommended Reserve:** 9-12 months for added security and acquisition attractiveness
- Once minimum reserve is met, maintain it by setting aside a percentage of monthly profit
- Larger reserves make the business more valuable to potential buyers

---

## 4. TAX STRUCTURE AND COMPLIANCE

### 4.1 LLC Tax Election
**Recommended Tax Structure:**
- Initially, the LLC will be taxed as a **Partnership** (default for multi-member LLC)
- Once SponsorSynq reaches **consistent profitability** (3+ months of positive cash flow), consider electing **S-Corporation tax status** to reduce self-employment taxes
- S-Corp election requires filing IRS Form 2553
- **Strongly recommended:** Consult with a CPA before making S-Corp election

### 4.2 Individual Tax Obligations
Each Co-Founder is responsible for their own tax obligations:

**Federal Taxes:**
- Set aside **25-30% of all distributions** for federal income tax and self-employment tax
- File **quarterly estimated tax payments** (IRS Form 1040-ES) to avoid penalties
- Quarterly deadlines: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15

**State Taxes:**
- Set aside **additional 3-7%** depending on state of residence (if applicable)
- File state quarterly estimated taxes as required by your state
- Both Co-Founders responsible for their own state tax obligations

**Tax Recommendations:**
- Each Co-Founder should open a separate **"Tax Savings Account"** to hold tax reserves
- Immediately transfer 25-30% of each distribution to this account
- **Hire a CPA** once revenue exceeds $50,000/year for professional tax guidance
- Keep detailed records of all business expenses for tax deductions
- Both Co-Founders receive equal K-1 forms (50/50 split) for tax filing

### 4.3 Business Tax Filings
- LLC must file annual tax returns (Form 1065 Partnership Return)
- Each Co-Founder receives Schedule K-1 showing their 50% share of profit/loss
- If S-Corp election made, file Form 1120-S instead
- State annual reports and franchise taxes paid from business account
- **CPA engagement recommended** once revenue is consistent

---

## 5. EXIT STRATEGY AND COMPANY SALE

### 5.1 Sale Valuation Based on Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
The Co-Founders agree that SponsorSynq's value shall be primarily determined by **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**:

- **Standard Valuation:** SponsorSynq may be sold for **8 times annual recurring revenue (ARR)**, which equals **8 × (MRR × 12)**
- Example: If MRR is $15,000, then ARR = $180,000, and sale price = $1,440,000 (8 × $180,000)
- Industry-standard SaaS multiples range from 4x-12x ARR depending on growth rate, profitability, and market conditions
- **8x ARR is a reasonable target** for a profitable, growing event sponsorship platform

### 5.2 Decision to Sell - Unanimous Consent Required
**BOTH Co-Founders must unanimously agree** on the following:
- **WHEN** to pursue a sale or exit
- **WHETHER** to accept an offer or continue operating
- **MINIMUM acceptable sale price**
- **TERMS** of the sale agreement
- **BUYER** selection and approval

**Sale Trigger Thresholds:**
- At any MRR level, either Co-Founder may propose considering sale offers
- Both Co-Founders must review and evaluate offers together
- **Neither Co-Founder can be forced to sell** without mutual agreement
- **Neither Co-Founder can unilaterally block a sale** above mutually agreed thresholds

### 5.3 Continue vs. Sell Decision Framework
When SponsorSynq reaches significant MRR milestones, both Co-Founders will jointly evaluate:

**Factors to Consider:**
- Current MRR and growth trajectory
- Profitability and cash flow
- Market conditions and competitive landscape
- Personal goals and financial needs of both Co-Founders
- Potential sale offers and valuations
- Long-term vision for the platform

**MRR-Based Discussion Milestones:**
- **$10,000 MRR:** First strategic review - are we on track?
- **$25,000 MRR:** Evaluate potential sale interest vs. continued growth
- **$50,000 MRR:** Formal discussion of exit timeline and targets
- **$100,000 MRR:** Likely attractive acquisition target - actively evaluate options

**Decision Rule:**
- Either Co-Founder may propose selling at any time
- Both must agree to proceed with sale discussions
- If one wants to sell and the other wants to continue, negotiate in good faith
- Consider buyout options if goals diverge significantly

### 5.4 Sale Proceeds Distribution
Upon sale of SponsorSynq:

**Distribution Order:**
1. Pay all outstanding debts, liabilities, and legal obligations
2. Reimburse both Co-Founders for any unpaid business expenses (50/50 verified)
3. Distribute remaining proceeds **50/50** to both Co-Founders
